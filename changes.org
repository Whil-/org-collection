#+TITLE: Changes
* 2021-05-15 (Version 0.2)
This software probably isn't used anywhere yet so no care is taken for
backwards compatability.

With the change today, some incompatabilities in user facing functions were added though. Notably the following:

Rename of:
- =org-collection-lock= to =org-collection-load=
- =org-collection-unlock= to =org-collection-unload=

Some new commands are added and some keyboard shortcuts are added.

** New commands
*** =org-collection-create=
Helper that will create and register a new location. Default template hardcoded.

*** =org-collection-visit-settings=
Helper that will take you to the settings-file of a collection of choice.

** Keyboard shortcut additions
- ~C-c z c~ (=org-collection-create=)
- ~C-c z s~ (=org-collection-visit-settings=)
- ~C-c z f~ (=org-collection-visit-file=)
